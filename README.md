# Publishing a static website with goHugo.io and dagger.io

Example project demonstrating [Dagger.io](https://dagger.io) CI/CD pipelines by building
and optimizing a website with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator and
optimizing PNG images via pngquant.

This example was used for the introductory talk on dagger.io at the
[Technology Day 2022](https://www.innoq.com/en/talks/2022/11/ci-cd-pipelines-with-dagger-io/)

## Preparation

- Clone this repository
- Install a docker compatible engine (I successfully used
  [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/))
- Install the stable node.js release and the dagger-cli (optional)
- npm install
- see ./run.sh and ./runWithCli.sh
